# dotfiles

Files that have been prepended with a dot. I use this to keep all of my machines configured exactly the same.

## Usage

If you are adding `dotfiles` for the firs time, you need to install it:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:corytheboyd/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
$ (cd ~/dotfiles && rake install)
```

Once installed, update by pulling changes comitted to this repository:
```
$ update_dotfiles
```
